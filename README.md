# Dino Extinction
![cover](https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/dinosaur-extinction-theories-top-ten-large.jpg)

The year is 2242. The mankind kingdom expanded from Earth to our entire solar system. Our society is flourishing and nothing can stop our species from conquering new solar systems. During our expansion, we met with an ancient enemy: Dinosaurs. We thought that this hostile predator was extinct 144 million years ago, but it appears that somehow the meteors mutated some dinosaurs and removed them from our home planet, creating some kind of huge titan and destructive interstellar object.

You're a captain of a strike fleet and your goal is simple: **destroy as most dinosaurs you can.**
